# Welcome to the FishTank project.

Hey, before you get started, you should get your self familiar with [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/). Once you get a hang of it, you can help out by proposing & implementing new features to our fish tank. For now all we have is 4 leds that you can control with two 10k potentiometers (color & brightness). 


# Parts list

 1. 5v power supply, 890 mah
 2. two 10k potentiometers
 3. one Arduino Uno board
 4. one 3D printed case to house all the components
 5. small led strip with 4 leds soldered on it.

# Todo

 1. add more led's
 2. some way to turn led's white
 3. temperature sensor
 4. screen with push button/potentiometer
